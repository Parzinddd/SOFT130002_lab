INSERT INTO `Genres` (`GenreID`, `GenreName`, `Description`, `Link`) VALUES (1, 'Cubism', '<strong>Cubism</strong> was a 20th century avant-garde art movement, pioneered by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, that revolutionized European painting and sculpture, and inspired related movements in music, literature and architecture. In cubist artworks, objects are broken up, analyzed, and re-assembled in an abstracted form—instead of depicting objects from one viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context. Often the surfaces intersect at seemingly random angles, removing a coherent sense of depth. The background and object planes interpenetrate one another to create the shallow ambiguous space, one of cubism\'s distinct characteristics.', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubism');
INSERT INTO `Genres` (`GenreID`, `GenreName`, `Description`, `Link`) VALUES (33, 'Romanticism', '<strong>Romanticism</strong> was an artistic, literary and intellectual movement that originated in the second half of the 18th century in Europe, and gained strength in reaction to the Industrial Revolution. In part, it was a revolt against aristocratic social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment and a reaction against the scientific rationalization of nature. It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature, but had a major impact on historiography, education[4] and natural history.', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism');
INSERT INTO `Genres` (`GenreID`, `GenreName`, `Description`, `Link`) VALUES (34, 'Realism', '<strong>Realism</strong> as a tendency in 19th century art was related to similar movements in the theatre, literature and opera. All emphasized the depiction of everyday subjects, but by no means always discarding classical, Romantic or sentimental approaches to their treatment. The movement began in the 1850s in France. One of Gustave Courbet\'s most important works is A Burial at Ornans, 1849-1850, a canvas recording an event which he witnessed in September 1848. Courbet\'s painting of the funeral of his grand uncle became the first grand statement of the Realist style.', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realist_painting');
INSERT INTO `Genres` (`GenreID`, `GenreName`, `Description`, `Link`) VALUES (35, 'Impressionism', '<strong>Impressionism</strong> was a 19th-century art movement that originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s. The name of the style is derived from the title of a Claude Monet work, Impression, soleil levant (Impression, Sunrise), which provoked the critic Louis Leroy to coin the term in a satiric review published in the Parisian newspaper Le Charivari.', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism');
INSERT INTO `Genres` (`GenreID`, `GenreName`, `Description`, `Link`) VALUES (36, 'Post-Impressionism', '<strong>Post-Impressionism</strong> is the term coined by the British artist and art critic Roger Fry in 1910 to describe the development of French art since Manet. Fry used the term when he organized the 1910 exhibition Manet and Post-Impressionism. Post-Impressionists extended Impressionism while rejecting its limitations: they continued using vivid colours, thick application of paint, distinctive brush strokes, and real-life subject matter, but they were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, to distort form for expressive effect, and to use unnatural or arbitrary colour.', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Impressionism');

While Fauvism as a style began around 1900 and continued beyond 1910, the movement as such lasted only a few years, 1904–1908, and had three exhibitions. The leaders of the movement were Henri Matisse and André Derain.', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauvism');
INSERT INTO `Genres` (`GenreID`, `GenreName`, `Description`, `Link`) VALUES (47, 'Surrealism', '<strong>Surrealism</strong> is a cultural movement that began in the early 1920s, and is best known for the visual artworks and writings of the group members. Surrealist works feature the element of surprise, unexpected juxtapositions and non sequitur; however, many Surrealist artists and writers[who?] regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost, with the works being an artifact. Leader André Breton was explicit in his assertion that Surrealism was above all a revolutionary movement.', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism');
INSERT INTO `Genres` (`GenreID`, `GenreName`, `Description`, `Link`) VALUES (56, 'Expressionism', '<strong>Expressionism</strong> was a modernist movement, initially in poetry and painting, originating in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century.

Expressionist artists sought to express meaning or emotional experience rather than physical reality.', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressionism');
INSERT INTO `Genres` (`GenreID`, `GenreName`, `Description`, `Link`) VALUES (64, 'Symbolism', '<strong>Symbolism</strong> was a late nineteenth-century art movement of French, Russian and Belgian origin in poetry and other arts. The aesthetic was developed by Stéphane Mallarmé and Paul Verlaine during the 1860s and \'70s. In the 1880s, the aesthetic was articulated by a series of manifestos and attracted a generation of writers. The name \"symbolist\" itself was first applied by the critic Jean Moréas, who invented the term to distinguish the symbolists from the related decadents of literature and of art.', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolism_(arts)');

Before 1597 Italian Renaissance humanism had little influence outside Italy. From the late 15th century the ideas spread around Europe.

INSERT INTO `Genres` (`GenreID`, `GenreName`, `Description`, `Link`) VALUES (78, 'Renaissance', '<strong>Renaissance</strong> art is the painting, sculpture and decorative arts of that period of European history known as the Renaissance, emerging as a distinct style in Italy in about 1400, in parallel with developments which occurred in philosophy, literature, music and science. Renaissance art, perceived as a \"rebirth\" of ancient traditions, took as its foundation the art of Classical antiquity, but transformed that tradition by the absorption of recent developments in the art of Northern Europe and by application of contemporary scientific knowledge. Renaissance art, with Renaissance Humanist philosophy, spread throughout Europe, affecting both artists and their patrons with the development of new techniques and new artistic sensibilities. Renaissance art marks the transition of Europe from the medieval period to the Early modern age.', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_art');
INSERT INTO `Genres` (`GenreID`, `GenreName`, `Description`, `Link`) VALUES (79, 'High Renaissance', '<strong>High Renaissance</strong> is the period denoting the apogee of the visual arts in the Italian Renaissance. The High Renaissance period is traditionally taken to begin in the 1490s, with Leonardo\'s fresco of the Last Supper in Milan and the death of Lorenzo de\' Medici in Florence, and to have ended in 1527 with the sacking of Rome by the troops of Charles V. This term was first used in German (Hochrenaissance) in the early nineteenth century, and has its origins in the \"High Style\" of painting and sculpture described by Johann Joachim Winckelmann. Over the last twenty years, use of the term has been frequently criticized by academic art historians for oversimplifying artistic developments, ignoring historical context, and focusing only on a few iconic works.', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Renaissance');

INSERT INTO `Genres` (`GenreID`, `GenreName`, `Description`, `Link`) VALUES (83, 'Rococo', '<strong>Rococo</strong>, less commonly roccoco, also referred to as \"Late Baroque\", is an 18th-century artistic movement and style, which affected several aspects of the arts including painting, sculpture, architecture, interior design, decoration, literature, music and theatre. The Rococo developed in the early part of the 18th century in Paris, France as a reaction against the grandeur, symmetry and strict regulations of the Baroque, especially that of the Palace of Versailles. In such a way, Rococo artists opted for a more jocular, florid and graceful approach to Baroque art and architecture. Rococo art and architecture in such a way was ornate and made strong usage of creamy, pastel-like colours, asymmetrical designs, curves and gold. Unlike the more politically focused Baroque, the Rococo had more playful and often witty artistic themes. With regards to interior decoration, Rococo rooms were designed as total works of art with elegant and ornate furniture, small sculptures, ornamental mirrors, and tapestry complementing architecture, reliefs, and wall paintings. The Rococo additionally played an important role in theatre. In the book The Rococo, it is written that there was no other culture which \"has produced a wittier, more elegant, and teasing dialogue full of elusive and camouflaging language and gestures, refined feelings and subtle criticism\" than Rococo theatre, especially that of France.', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rococo');
INSERT INTO `Genres` (`GenreID`, `GenreName`, `Description`, `Link`) VALUES (84, 'Baroque', 'The <strong>Baroque</strong> is a period of artistic style that used exaggerated motion and clear, easily interpreted detail to produce drama, tension, exuberance, and grandeur in sculpture, painting, architecture, literature, dance and music. The style began around 1600 in Rome, Italy and spread to most of Europe. The popularity and success of the Baroque style was encouraged by the Roman Catholic Church, which had decided at the time of the Council of Trent, in response to the Protestant Reformation, that the arts should communicate religious themes in direct and emotional involvement. The aristocracy also saw the dramatic style of Baroque architecture and art as a means of impressing visitors and expressing triumphant power and control. Baroque palaces are built around an entrance of courts, grand staircases and reception rooms of sequentially increasing opulence.', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque');

Although Dutch painting of the Golden Age comes in the general European period of Baroque painting, and often shows many of its characteristics, most lacks the idealization and love of splendour typical of much Baroque work, including that of neighbouring Flanders. Most work, including that for which the period is best known, reflects the traditions of detailed realism inherited from Early Netherlandish painting.', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Golden_Age_painting');
INSERT INTO `Genres` (`GenreID`, `GenreName`, `Description`, `Link`) VALUES (88, 'Academic Art', '<strong>Academic Art<strong> is a style of painting and sculpture produced under the influence of European academies of art. Specifically, academic art is the art and artists influenced by the standards of the French Académie des Beaux-Arts, which practiced under the movements of Neoclassicism and Romanticism, and the art that followed these two movements in the attempt to synthesize both of their styles, and which is best reflected by the paintings of William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Thomas Couture, and Hans Makart. In this context it is often called \"academism\", \"academicism\", \"L\'art pompier\", and \"eclecticism\", and sometimes linked with \"historicism\" and \"syncretism\". The art influenced by academies in general is also called \"academic art.\" In this context as new styles are embraced by academics, the new styles come to be considered academic, thus what was at one time a rebellion against academic art becomes academic art.', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_art');

Two are shown with African mask-like faces and three more with faces in the Iberian style of Picasso\'s native Spain, giving them a savage aura. In this adaptation of Primitivism and abandonment of perspective in favor of a flat, two-dimensional picture plane, Picasso makes a radical departure from traditional European painting. The work is widely considered to be seminal in the early development of both cubism and modern art. Demoiselles was revolutionary and controversial, and led to wide anger and disagreement, even amongst his closest associates and friends.\r\nPainted in Paris during the summer of 1907, Picasso had created hundreds of sketches and studies in preparation for the final work. He long acknowledged the importance of Spanish art and Iberian sculpture as influences on the painting. The work is believed by critics to be influenced by African tribal masks and the art of Oceania, although Picasso denied the connection; many art historians remain skeptical about his denials. Several experts maintain that, at the very least, Picasso visited the Musée d\'Ethnographie du Trocadéro (known today as Musée de l\'Homme) in the spring of 1907 where he saw and was unconsciously influenced by African and Tribal art several months before completing Demoiselles.

I want to make modern people, in their essential traits, move about as they do on those friezes, and place them on canvases organized by harmonies of color.\" Some contemporary critics, however, found his figures to be less a nod to earlier art history than a commentary on the posturing and artificiality of modern Parisian society.Seurat made the final changes to La Grande Jatte in 1889.

Although it draws on many sources from both high and popular art, The Third of May 1808 marks a clear break from convention. Diverging from the traditions of Christian art and traditional depictions of war, it has no distinct precedent, and is acknowledged as one of the first paintings of the modern era. According to the art historian Kenneth Clark, The Third of May 1808 is \"the first great picture which can be called revolutionary in every sense of the word, in style, in subject, and in intention\".', '<em>The Third of May 1808</em> is a painting completed in 1814 by the Spanish painter Francisco Goya, now in the Museo del Prado, Madrid.

In this decade, the artist created a puzzling, ornamental encoded programme that revolved around the mystery of existence, love and fulfilment through art. Klimt gained initial inspiration for this in 1903 on a journey to Ravenna to see the Byzantine mosaics. In addition, the painting contains a myriad of motifs from various cultural epochs, above all from Ancient Egyptian mythology. Most recent research has, however, revealed that it is not enough to read the ornaments in the picture just as symbols rooted in tradition aiming to convey a timelessly valid message.

The painting is also reminiscent of Francisco Goya\'s painting, <em>The Nude Maja</em> (1800).\r\nManet embarked on the canvas after being challenged to give the Salon a nude painting to display. His uniquely frank depiction of a self-assured prostitute was accepted by the Paris Salon in 1865, where it created a scandal. According to Antonin Proust, \"only the precautions taken by the administration prevented the painting being punctured and torn\" by offended viewers. The painting was controversial partly because the nude is wearing some small items of clothing such as an orchid in her hair, a bracelet, a ribbon around her neck, and mule slippers, all of which accentuated her nakedness, sexuality, and comfortable courtesan lifestyle. The orchid, upswept hair, black cat, and bouquet of flowers were all recognized symbols of sexuality at the time. This modern Venus\' body is thin, counter to prevailing standards; the painting\'s lack of idealism rankled viewers. The painting\'s flatness, inspired by Japanese wood block art, serves to make the nude more human and less voluptuous. A fully dressed black servant is featured, exploiting the then-current theory that black people were hyper-sexed. That she is wearing the clothing of a servant to a courtesan here, furthers the sexual tension of the piece.\r\nOlympia\'s body as well as her gaze is unabashedly confrontational. She defiantly looks out as her servant offers flowers from one of her male suitors.

Raphael gave the Madonna in the Meadow to his Florentine patron Taddeo Taddi as a gift; in 1662 it was acquired at its place of origin by Archduke Ferdinand Karl of Tirol.

The cross is simultaneously a toy, an attribute of John the Baptist and a Passion symbol. The latter is also true of the conspicuously positioned poppy on the right.

Thus there was a demand that the contours in painting be dear and sometimes even sharp. Bronzino’s works are considered the epitome of Florentine disegno and, at the same time, its final pinnacle, which had already assumed the character of Mannerism. Bronzino, who was a pupil of Jacopo Pontormo and thus extremely familiar with the works of Michelangelo, served for many years as court painter to the Medici. He created decorations (now lost) for numerous theatrical works and festive occasions and supplied brilliant designs for the Medici tapestry factory. In his composition Bronzino organises the group in close proximity to one another in the foreground. Nevertheless the figures are arranged next to and behind each other in a way that makes them easy to recognise. The infant St. John is in the foremost position, his gaze and gesture pointing to the infant Jesus, who is depicted frontally. Behind them stands St. Mary, who is holding her son’s arm in a loving gesture. The composition is extended by St. Anne and St. Joseph, who stand out from the central group of three because of their more natural skin colour. More than in almost any other of his works, Bronzino has emphasised the sharply outlined and sculptural figures almost to the point of stony coldness, especially in the case of the two boys. This artistic decision is also an example of paragone (Italian: comparison) – the competition, discussed in art theory at the time, between painting and sculpture to see which could create the better depiction of three-dimensional forms.
